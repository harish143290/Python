Command line arguments :
    input( ) -> str
       Used to extract the input from the user.

    command line arguments is an alternative way to
    pass the values to programm.

    command line arguments is the process of passing the
    values to the program along with prgname by time of
    execution through command prompt.

        Eg: >py prgname.py  arg1 arg2 ..... argn
        Eg: >py cmd1.py 10 20 30

    * we can pass N no.of. arguments and Any type of
    arguments but each value should be sep by space

    * The values which we are passing through command
       prompt those values will be stored in the "argv"
       variable of 'type list' from 'sys' module.

   * The values which we are passing through command
   prompt those value are treated by PVM as string only.

   * While passing string value recommanded to take
   in between or " " 
       
   * argv[0] is always holding the Prgname
   
   * argv[1] ... argv[n] will have command line arguments.
