# INSTANCE FIELD | NON STATIC FIELD :
#     * The variables which are declared with
#     in the method by using "self" called instance field
#
#     * For Instance Fields memory allocated with in the
#     object.
#
#     * Instance fields can be accessed through out the class
#     and outside of the class.
#
#     * Every instance field must be referred by using "self"
#     through out the class.
#
#     * Every Instance field must be referred by an object
#     reference whenever  u want access it from outside of
#     the class.
#
#     * For Every instance field an individual memory blocks
#     are created in every new object of the same class.
#     thus changing the value of an instance field
#     in object which is not effected to the same instance field
#     of another object of the same class.
#
#
#     Note: Based on the application requirements we can
#     add an instance field to an object from outside of the
#     class.
#
#         Syn: <object ref>.<fieldname>=value
#
#      Note: We can also delete and instance field from
#      an object from the outside of the class .
#
#            Syn: del <objectref>.<fieldname>
