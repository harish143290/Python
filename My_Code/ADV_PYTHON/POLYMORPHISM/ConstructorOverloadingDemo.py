    In Other Languages Constructor overloading
    is the process of defining more than one constructor
    for different purpose.

    In Python if we define more than one constructor
    then priority is given to last defined constructor only.
    thus defining morethan one constructor meaning less.

    In Python constructor overloading is the process of
    making the constructor to perform more than one
    operation.
