# polymorphism
#    poly means many
#    morphism is nothing forms or behaviours
#
#
#   Example :  +
#          int + int -> int [Addition]
#          10 + 20 -> 30
#
#          str + str -> str [concatenation]
#          "shashi" + "kumar"  --> "shashikumar"
#
#          *
#          int * int -> int ( product )
#          10 * 2 -> 20
#
#           str * int -> str ( repeat)
#           "sai"*3 -> saisaisai
#
#   In Other Languages
#      polymorphism classified into 2 types
#        1.compile-time polymorphism
#        2.run-time polymorphism
#
#  In Python there is no
#       Compile-time and run-time polymorphism.
#
#       In Python polymorphism can be done by using
#       the following.
#
#          1.Method Overloading
#          2.Constructor Overloading
#          3.Method Overriding
#          4.Constructor Overriding
#               MRO
#
#          5.Operator overloading.
