# Method Overloading :
#     In Other Languages Method Overloading
#     is the process of defining more than one method
#     with the same name for different purpose.
#
#     In Python if we define more than one method with the
#     same name the priority is given to last defined method.
#     thus defining more than one method with same name
#     is meaningless.
#
#     As per python method overloading is the process of
#     making a method to perform more than one operation
#     Behaviour.
