# ASSERT
#   > assert keyword for Debugging Purpose
#   > Debugging is the process of executing the program
#      in our own style inorder to identify the bugs | Error
#
#    >In Programming we are working print() for debugging
#        Eg:  In PDBC
#                      we have written some debugging statement(s)
#                      in the program by using print( )
#
#                      Eg: print("Connection is Est ")
#                              ...
#                             print("Cursor object is created ....")
# cc
#         debugging using print is not recommanded .Reason
#         debugging is done at the dev or testing phase in SDLC
#
#         debugging activity is not required at client place.
#         i.e debugging message are not required display
#         at client place. thus we have to remove debugging
#         statement(s) after debugging activity, which not
#         recommanded.
#
#         Syn: assert <condition>,"message"
#
#         if assert condition is True, Till that assert statement
#         there is no bug and code will be executed.
#
#         if assert condition is False, It seems there is a bug
#         it will display Error Message by raising AssertionError.
