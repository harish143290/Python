# * In Python Every thing will be stored
# in the form of an object.
#
#            Eg:  x=10
#             Internally PVM will create an object of <class 'int'>
#
# * Whenever u define any function, internally PVM
# will create an object of <class 'function'>
#
# * However we are working with other type of Objects the
# same manner we can also work with function object.
# ie.
#    1.we can assign function object to  a variable
#    2.we can pass a function as an argument to another
#        function
#    3.we can define a function inside another function.
#    4.A function can return another fun.
