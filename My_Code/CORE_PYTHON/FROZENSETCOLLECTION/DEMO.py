Diff between set vs frozenset

  > set and frozenset will work almost same
  > set is mutable collection where as frozenset immutable
  > we can create set collection by using
         set( )
         set(iterable)

  >  we can create frozenset collection by using
          frozenset()
          frozenset(iterable)

   Note: We can perform all set related operations
   such as (union | intersection | difference |
                    symmetric_difference | issubset |
                   issuperset ).
